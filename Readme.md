We may need to write an overview of what this is.

# Some commit rules:

We could use the format `type [!](context):  brief description`

- `<type>`: Use one and only one type from the type section below.
- `!`: (Optional) May be written when a conflict generated was terrific.
- `(context)`: (Optional), context of what you have changed. Could be the name of the script.
- `brief description`: One line and brief description of the commit.

## Types:
- **hito**: Set a milestone in the whole repository. 
- **feat**: Modify code to implement new feature/etc.
- **docs**: Add documentation. Changed readme or added another thing like that.
- **fix**: Fix a mistake in the code, bug.
- **test**: Add/modify/fix tests.
- **style**: Add/modify spaces/ tabs/ lines/ format. Nothing related to algorithms.
- **refactor**: Modify the way that an algorithm works (run time or structure).
- **chore**: Nothing related to above and may be part of a silly commit as well.
- **99**: Silly commit.
